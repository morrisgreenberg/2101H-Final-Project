# 2101H-Final-Project

This is the final project for STA 2101 H (course website here: https://utstat.toronto.edu/reid/html/sta/sta2101f2020.html)

My project is focusing on trends in partisanship in US elections, combining data from presidential elections and senate elections courtesy of the MIT Election Lab (datasets can be found [here for president](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX) and [here for senate](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PEJ5QU))
